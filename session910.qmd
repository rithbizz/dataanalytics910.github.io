## 💡 Why It Matters
Raw data is just a pile of numbers. Descriptive statistics turns that pile into **insight** — answering "what is typical?" and "how spread out is the data?"
:::

## Today's Plan

**Descriptive Statistics — 3 Hours:**

1. **Introduction** — What is descriptive statistics and why do we use it?
2. **Part 1: Measures of Central Tendency** — Mean, Median, Mode
3. **Part 2: Measures of Dispersion** — Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, IQR
4. **Part 3: Choosing the Right Measure** — When to use what
5. **Part 4: Real-World Use Cases & Projects**
6. **Part 5: Computing with Python**

::: {.callout-tip}
**⏱️ Time:** ~3 hours | **📝 Goal:** Describe any dataset with confidence using the right statistics!
:::

## Learning Objectives

**By the end of this class, you will:**

- Understand what descriptive statistics summarizes about data
- Calculate and interpret mean, median, and mode
- Calculate and interpret range, variance, standard deviation, and IQR
- Know which measure is best for different types of data
- Detect outliers and understand their effect
- Apply descriptive statistics to real-world datasets using Python

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Hands-On Learning
Every concept comes with manual calculation, real-world examples, and Python code!
:::

# Introduction: What is Descriptive Statistics?

## Data Without Statistics

Imagine you receive this dataset — exam scores from 20 students:

```
72, 85, 91, 63, 78, 55, 88, 94, 71, 67,
82, 79, 95, 60, 74, 88, 53, 77, 83, 69
```

**Questions a teacher might ask:**

- What is the *typical* score in this class?
- Are students' scores close together or very spread out?
- Is the class performing well overall?
- Are there any unusually high or low scores?

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 The Problem
20 numbers are manageable. But what about 2,000? Or 200,000?
We need tools to **summarize** data into meaningful numbers.
:::

## Two Main Questions in Descriptive Statistics

::: {style="text-align:center; margin-top: 20px;"}

| Question | Answered By | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **What is the typical value?** | Measures of **Central Tendency** | Mean, Median, Mode |
| **How spread out is the data?** | Measures of **Dispersion** | Range, Variance, Std Dev, IQR |

:::

```
Data: 55, 63, 67, 69, 71, 72, 74, 77, 78, 79,
      82, 83, 85, 88, 88, 91, 94, 95, 53, 60

Central Tendency → "The typical score is around 76"
Dispersion       → "Scores range from 53 to 95 — quite spread out"
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Together they tell the full story
A mean of 76 means very different things if the std deviation is 3 (tight cluster) vs 20 (very spread out).
:::

## Real-World Applications

**Where descriptive statistics is used every day:**

- 🏥 **Healthcare** — Average patient recovery time, spread of blood pressure readings
- 🏫 **Education** — Class average, score distribution, identifying struggling students
- 💰 **Finance** — Average stock return, volatility (dispersion) of investments
- 🌦️ **Weather** — Mean temperature, typical rainfall variation
- 🏭 **Manufacturing** — Average product weight, quality control tolerance
- 🛒 **Business** — Average customer spending, variation in daily sales
- ⚽ **Sports** — Average goals per game, consistency of a player's performance

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Before any advanced analysis
Descriptive statistics is always the **first step** — you must understand your data before modeling it!
:::

---

# Part 1: Measures of Central Tendency

## What is Central Tendency?

::: {style="text-align:center; margin-top: 30px;"}
### A measure of **central tendency** finds the **center** or **typical value** of a dataset {style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.4em;"}
:::

**Three measures:**

| Measure | Definition | Best For |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Mean** | Sum of all values ÷ count | Symmetric data, no outliers |
| **Median** | Middle value when sorted | Skewed data, outliers present |
| **Mode** | Most frequently occurring value | Categorical data, finding peaks |

**Intuition:**

- **Mean** — the "fair share" if you redistributed everything equally
- **Median** — the "middle person" in a line sorted by height
- **Mode** — the "most popular" item in a store

## 1.1 — The Mean (Average)

**Formula:**

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}$$

**Step-by-step example — Weekly sales ($):**

```
Data: 200, 350, 280, 410, 300
```

**Calculate:**

$$\bar{x} = \frac{200 + 350 + 280 + 410 + 300}{5} = \frac{1540}{5} = 308$$

The **mean weekly sales is $308**.

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Intuition
If you spread the total sales ($1,540) equally across all 5 days, each day would have $308.
:::

## Mean — More Examples

**Example 1: Student test scores**
```
Scores: 70, 85, 90, 60, 75
Mean = (70 + 85 + 90 + 60 + 75) / 5 = 380 / 5 = 76
```

**Example 2: Daily temperatures (°C)**
```
Mon: 28, Tue: 31, Wed: 29, Thu: 35, Fri: 27, Sat: 30, Sun: 32
Mean = (28+31+29+35+27+30+32) / 7 = 212 / 7 ≈ 30.3°C
```

**Example 3: Hospital patient ages**
```
Ages: 25, 34, 45, 67, 23, 54, 38, 29
Mean = (25+34+45+67+23+54+38+29) / 8 = 315 / 8 ≈ 39.4 years
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 🔢 Symbol note
$\bar{x}$ (x-bar) = sample mean | $\mu$ (mu) = population mean
:::

## Mean — The Outlier Problem

The mean is **sensitive to extreme values (outliers)**:

**Example: Monthly salaries at a small company ($)**
```
Employee A: 1,200
Employee B: 1,400
Employee C: 1,300
Employee D: 1,500
CEO:       50,000
```

$$\bar{x} = \frac{1200 + 1400 + 1300 + 1500 + 50000}{5} = \frac{55400}{5} = 11080$$

**Is $11,080 a "typical" salary here? NO!** Four out of five people earn around $1,350.

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Outlier Effect
One extreme value (the CEO's salary) pulled the mean far above the typical salary.
This is when we use the **Median** instead!
:::

## 1.2 — The Median

**The Median is the middle value when data is sorted.**

**Steps to find the Median:**

1. **Sort** the data from smallest to largest
2. **If n is odd** → median = middle value
3. **If n is even** → median = average of two middle values

**Example 1 (odd count — 5 values):**
```
Unsorted: 85, 70, 90, 60, 75
Sorted:   60, 70, 75, 85, 90
                   ↑
              Median = 75
```

**Example 2 (even count — 6 values):**
```
Unsorted: 85, 70, 90, 60, 75, 80
Sorted:   60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90
                   ↑  ↑
              Median = (75 + 80) / 2 = 77.5
```

## Median — Resistant to Outliers

**Same salary example as before:**
```
Sorted: 1,200 | 1,300 | 1,400 | 1,500 | 50,000
                          ↑
                    Median = 1,400
```

**Mean = $11,080** — misleading!
**Median = $1,400** — much more representative of a typical employee!

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Key Insight
- Real estate: "median home price" (not mean) — because a few mansions skew the mean
- Income reports: "median household income" — because billionaires skew the mean
- The **median** always tells you "half the values are below this, half are above"
:::

## Median — More Examples

**Example: House prices in a neighborhood ($1000s)**
```
Sorted: 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 195, 850
                         ↑
                    Median = 165 (thousand)
Mean = (120+135+150+165+180+195+850)/7 = 256 (thousand)
```
The $850k mansion pulls the mean to $256k, but median says $165k is typical.

**Example: Response times for a website (ms)**
```
Sorted: 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 980
Median = 135 ms   ← typical user experience
Mean   = 253 ms   ← distorted by 1 slow request
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Use Median when
Your data has outliers, or is skewed (not symmetric).
:::

## 1.3 — The Mode

**The Mode is the value that appears most frequently.**

**Simple example:**
```
Data: 3, 7, 3, 9, 3, 5, 7, 2
Mode = 3  (appears 3 times — more than any other)
```

**Multiple modes:**
```
Data: 2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8, 10
Mode = 4 and 8  (both appear twice → Bimodal)
```

**No mode:**
```
Data: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Mode = None  (all values appear once)
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 🔢 Types of mode distribution
- **Unimodal** — one mode (one peak)
- **Bimodal** — two modes (two peaks)
- **Multimodal** — three or more modes
- **No mode** — all values unique
:::

## Mode — Real-World Use Cases

**Example 1: Shoe sizes sold in a store**
```
Sizes: 38, 40, 39, 41, 40, 40, 38, 42, 40, 39
Mode = 40  ← The store should stock the most size 40!
```

**Example 2: Favorite subject (survey of 15 students)**
```
Math, Science, Math, Khmer, English, Math, Science,
Math, English, Khmer, Math, Science, Math, English, Math
Mode = Math  ← Most popular subject
```

**Example 3: Number of siblings**
```
Data: 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1
Mode = 1  ← Most families have 1 sibling
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Mode is the ONLY measure for categorical data
You cannot compute a mean or median of colors, names, or categories — but you CAN find a mode!
:::

## Comparing Mean, Median, Mode

**Dataset: Monthly income of 9 households ($)**
```
800, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1200, 1300, 8000
```

| Measure | Value | Interpretation |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **Mean** | $1,811 | Pulled up by outlier |
| **Median** | $1,050 | Middle household income |
| **Mode** | None | All values unique |

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Which to report?
In this case, **median** best represents a "typical" household.
The mean of $1,811 would mislead people into thinking incomes are higher than they really are.
:::

## Symmetric vs Skewed Data

The **relationship between mean and median** reveals the shape of data:

```
Symmetric (normal):   Mean ≈ Median ≈ Mode
                      [Bell curve — mean is reliable]

Right-skewed:         Mode < Median < Mean
                      [Long tail to the right — median is safer]
                      Example: income, house prices

Left-skewed:          Mean < Median < Mode
                      [Long tail to the left]
                      Example: age at retirement
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 🔍 Quick check
If mean > median → data is likely right-skewed (pulled by high outliers)
If mean < median → data is likely left-skewed (pulled by low outliers)
:::

## Practice 1A — Calculate by Hand

**Dataset: Exam scores of 10 students**
```
88, 73, 95, 61, 88, 77, 84, 91, 61, 72
```

Calculate:

1. **Mean** = ?
2. **Median** = ? *(sort first!)*
3. **Mode** = ?

::: {.callout-tip}
## ✏️ Work it out
Sorted: 61, 61, 72, 73, 77, 84, 88, 88, 91, 95

Mean   = (61+61+72+73+77+84+88+88+91+95) / 10 = 790 / 10 = **79.0**

Median = (77 + 84) / 2 = **80.5**  ← average of 5th and 6th values

Mode   = **61 and 88**  ← both appear twice (Bimodal)
:::

## Practice 1B — Salary Analysis

**A company has these employee salaries ($/month):**
```
2,500 | 2,800 | 3,100 | 2,800 | 2,600 | 2,800 | 45,000
```

1. Compute the **mean**, **median**, and **mode**
2. Which measure best represents a "typical" salary? Why?
3. The CEO earns $45,000 — how does this affect each measure?

::: {.callout-tip}
## ✏️ Solution
Mean   = (2500+2800+3100+2800+2600+2800+45000)/7 = 61600/7 ≈ **$8,800**

Sorted: 2500, 2600, 2800, 2800, 2800, 3100, 45000

Median = **$2,800**  (4th value)

Mode   = **$2,800**  (appears 3 times)

→ **Median and Mode are better here.** The CEO's salary ($45k) inflates the mean dramatically.
:::

---

# Part 2: Measures of Dispersion

## What is Dispersion?

::: {style="text-align:center; margin-top: 30px;"}
### **Dispersion** measures how **spread out** or **scattered** the data values are {style="color: #2980b9; font-size: 1.4em;"}
:::

**Why does it matter?**

```
Class A scores: 75, 76, 74, 75, 75, 76    → Mean = 75.2
Class B scores: 50, 60, 95, 40, 100, 81   → Mean = 71.0
```

Just knowing the mean doesn't tell the whole story! Class A is consistent; Class B is wildly varied.

**Four key measures of dispersion:**

| Measure | What it tells you |
|---------|------------------|
| **Range** | The full spread (max − min) |
| **Variance** | Average squared distance from the mean |
| **Standard Deviation** | Typical distance from the mean |
| **IQR** | Spread of the middle 50% |

## 2.1 — Range

**Range = Maximum value − Minimum value**

$$\text{Range} = x_{\max} - x_{\min}$$

**Example 1: Daily temperatures (°C)**
```
Data: 22, 27, 31, 19, 35, 28, 24
Min = 19,  Max = 35
Range = 35 − 19 = 16°C
```

**Example 2: Marathon finishing times (minutes)**
```
Data: 210, 185, 240, 195, 228, 175, 260
Min = 175,  Max = 260
Range = 260 − 175 = 85 minutes
```

**Example 3: Student test scores**
```
Data: 45, 62, 78, 88, 91, 55, 70
Min = 45,  Max = 91
Range = 91 − 45 = 46 points
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Limitation of Range
Range only uses 2 values (min and max). One extreme outlier completely changes it!
:::

## Range — Limitation Example

```
Dataset A: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
Range = 50 − 10 = 40

Dataset B: 10, 29, 30, 31, 50
Range = 50 − 10 = 40  ← Same range!
```

But Dataset A is evenly spread; Dataset B is mostly clustered around 30.

**Range cannot capture this difference.** We need better measures!

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Range is useful when
- You just want a quick, simple overview
- You are checking if any value is out of an expected range (quality control)
- Data has no obvious outliers
:::

## 2.2 — Variance

**Variance measures the average squared distance of each value from the mean.**

$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$

*(We use n−1 for sample variance — Bessel's correction)*

**Steps:**

1. Calculate the **mean** ($\bar{x}$)
2. Subtract the mean from each value → **deviations** $(x_i - \bar{x})$
3. **Square** each deviation → $(x_i - \bar{x})^2$
4. **Sum** all squared deviations
5. **Divide** by $n - 1$

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Why square the deviations?
Without squaring, deviations above and below the mean cancel out to zero!
Squaring makes all values positive, so large deviations have a large effect.
:::

## Variance — Step-by-Step Calculation

**Dataset: Hours of study per day for 5 students**
```
Data: 2, 4, 4, 6, 4    → Mean = (2+4+4+6+4)/5 = 20/5 = 4
```

| $x_i$ | $x_i - \bar{x}$ | $(x_i - \bar{x})^2$ |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 2      | 2 − 4 = −2      | (−2)² = **4**        |
| 4      | 4 − 4 =  0      | (0)²  = **0**        |
| 4      | 4 − 4 =  0      | (0)²  = **0**        |
| 6      | 6 − 4 = +2      | (+2)² = **4**        |
| 4      | 4 − 4 =  0      | (0)²  = **0**        |
|        | **Sum** =  0    | **Sum = 8**          |

$$s^2 = \frac{8}{5 - 1} = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \text{ hours}^2$$

## Variance — Why Units Are Squared

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Variance is in squared units
If data is in **hours**, variance is in **hours²**  
If data is in **dollars**, variance is in **dollars²**  
If data is in **°C**, variance is in **°C²**

This makes it **hard to interpret directly** — we can't say "the typical deviation is 2 hours²"!

**Solution → Standard Deviation** (take the square root)
:::

**Variance is still useful for:**

- Comparing relative spread between datasets (same units)
- Mathematical calculations in advanced statistics
- Portfolio risk in finance (portfolio variance)

## 2.3 — Standard Deviation

**Standard Deviation = Square root of the Variance**

$$s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

**Continuing our example:**

$$s = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.41 \text{ hours}$$

**Interpretation:** On average, students deviate from the mean study time by about **1.41 hours**.

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Standard Deviation is the most widely used measure of spread
It is in the **same units as the data**, making it directly interpretable!
:::

## Standard Deviation — Full Example

**Factory Machine A produces bolts with these diameters (mm):**
```
Data: 10.1, 10.2, 9.9, 10.0, 10.3, 9.8, 10.2
Mean = 70.5 / 7 ≈ 10.07 mm
```

| $x_i$ | $x_i - \bar{x}$ | $(x_i - \bar{x})^2$ |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 10.1   | +0.03           | 0.0009 |
| 10.2   | +0.13           | 0.0169 |
| 9.9    | −0.17           | 0.0289 |
| 10.0   | −0.07           | 0.0049 |
| 10.3   | +0.23           | 0.0529 |
| 9.8    | −0.27           | 0.0729 |
| 10.2   | +0.13           | 0.0169 |

$$s^2 = \frac{0.1943}{6} \approx 0.0324 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s \approx 0.18 \text{ mm}$$

**The machine's output varies by about ±0.18 mm** — acceptable or not? Depends on tolerance!

## Standard Deviation — Comparing Datasets

**This is where standard deviation really shines:**

```
Archer A hits: 85, 86, 84, 85, 85, 84, 86
Mean = 85.0,  Std Dev ≈ 0.82  ← Very consistent! 🎯

Archer B hits: 70, 95, 80, 100, 65, 90, 85
Mean = 83.6,  Std Dev ≈ 13.0  ← Very inconsistent! 😬
```

**Similar means, very different standard deviations!**

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Real-world comparisons
- **Investment risk:** Low std dev = stable returns, High std dev = volatile (risky)
- **Manufacturing:** Low std dev = consistent quality, High std dev = defects
- **Exam results:** Low std dev = similar performance, High std dev = mixed class
:::

## Standard Deviation — The 68-95-99.7 Rule

For **normally distributed data**, standard deviation has a powerful interpretation:

$$\mu \pm 1s \rightarrow \approx 68\% \text{ of data}$$
$$\mu \pm 2s \rightarrow \approx 95\% \text{ of data}$$
$$\mu \pm 3s \rightarrow \approx 99.7\% \text{ of data}$$

**Example: Exam scores with Mean = 75, Std Dev = 10**
```
68% of students scored between 65 and 85   (75 ± 10)
95% of students scored between 55 and 95   (75 ± 20)
99.7% of students scored between 45 and 105 (75 ± 30)
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 🔍 Practical use
A score more than 2 standard deviations from the mean is unusual (only 5% of the data).
This is the basis of detecting **outliers**!
:::

## 2.4 — Interquartile Range (IQR)

**IQR measures the spread of the middle 50% of data.**

**Steps:**

1. Sort the data
2. Find **Q1** (25th percentile — median of the lower half)
3. Find **Q3** (75th percentile — median of the upper half)
4. **IQR = Q3 − Q1**

**Example: Delivery times (minutes)**
```
Sorted: 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 35, 40, 45
              ↑                          ↑
             Q1                         Q3

Lower half:  15, 18, 20, 22, 25  →  Q1 = 20
Upper half:  28, 30, 35, 40, 45  →  Q3 = 35

IQR = Q3 − Q1 = 35 − 20 = 15 minutes
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 IQR ignores outliers completely
Only looks at the middle 50%, so extreme values have NO effect!
:::

## IQR — Outlier Detection

IQR is used to formally define outliers:

$$\text{Lower fence} = Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR$$
$$\text{Upper fence} = Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR$$

**Values outside these fences are outliers!**

**Example: Continuing from before (IQR = 15, Q1 = 20, Q3 = 35)**
```
Lower fence = 20 − 1.5 × 15 = 20 − 22.5 = −2.5
Upper fence = 35 + 1.5 × 15 = 35 + 22.5 = 57.5

Any delivery time below −2.5 or above 57.5 is an outlier.
```

Now add a bad day: `15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 35, 40, 45, **120**`
```
120 > 57.5 → 120 is an OUTLIER! 🚨
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Box plots
IQR is the foundation of the **box plot** (box-and-whisker plot) — a key visualization in data analysis!
:::

## Comparing All Dispersion Measures

**Dataset: Monthly expenses ($) of 8 students**
```
Data: 150, 200, 180, 500, 160, 190, 170, 180
```

| Measure | Value | Interpretation |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Range | 500 − 150 = **$350** | Full spread — affected by $500 outlier |
| Variance | **$10,250** | Squared dollars — hard to interpret |
| Std Dev | **≈ $101** | Average deviation from mean |
| IQR | **$30** | Middle 50% has only $30 variation! |

::: {.callout-note}
## 🔍 Insight
The IQR of $30 reveals that most students spend similarly. The high range and std dev are caused by just one outlier ($500). Remove that student and the data is very tight.
:::

## Practice 2A — Calculate Dispersion by Hand

**Dataset: Heights of 7 basketball players (cm)**
```
185, 192, 178, 201, 188, 195, 183
```

Calculate:

1. **Range** = ?
2. **Mean** = ?
3. **Variance** = ? *(show the deviation table)*
4. **Standard Deviation** = ?

::: {.callout-tip}
## ✏️ Solution
Mean = (185+192+178+201+188+195+183)/7 = 1322/7 ≈ **188.9 cm**

Range = 201 − 178 = **23 cm**

Deviations²: (−3.9)²=15.2, (3.1)²=9.6, (−10.9)²=118.8, (12.1)²=146.4, (−0.9)²=0.8, (6.1)²=37.2, (−5.9)²=34.8

Variance = (15.2+9.6+118.8+146.4+0.8+37.2+34.8)/6 = 362.8/6 ≈ **60.5 cm²**

Std Dev = √60.5 ≈ **7.78 cm**
:::

## Practice 2B — IQR and Outlier Detection

**Dataset: Daily number of customer complaints for 11 days**
```
3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 4, 5, 3, 4, 50, 5
```

1. Sort the data and find Q1, Q3, and IQR
2. Calculate the outlier fences
3. Identify any outliers
4. What does the outlier suggest about that day?

::: {.callout-tip}
## ✏️ Solution
Sorted: 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 50

Q1 = 4 (median of lower half: 3,3,4,4,4)
Q3 = 6 (median of upper half: 5,5,6,7,50)

IQR = 6 − 4 = **2**

Lower fence = 4 − 1.5×2 = **1**
Upper fence = 6 + 1.5×2 = **9**

50 > 9 → **50 is an outlier!** 🚨 Something unusual happened that day — investigate!

# Part 3: Choosing the Right Measure

## When to Use Each Measure

| Situation | Central Tendency | Dispersion |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| Symmetric data, no outliers | **Mean** | **Std Dev / Variance** |
| Skewed data or outliers | **Median** | **IQR** |
| Categorical data | **Mode** | N/A |
| Finding most common value | **Mode** | — |
| Comparing spread across groups | **Mean** | **Std Dev** |
| Outlier detection | **Median** | **IQR** |
| Financial risk analysis | **Mean** | **Variance / Std Dev** |

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 The Golden Rule
When data has **outliers** → prefer **Median + IQR**
When data is **clean and symmetric** → prefer **Mean + Std Dev**
:::

## Decision Guide — Real Scenarios

**Scenario 1:** A city reports average income to attract investors
→ Outliers (rich residents) exist → Use **Median**

**Scenario 2:** A factory monitors bolt diameter for quality control
→ Data should be symmetric, precise → Use **Mean + Std Dev**

**Scenario 3:** A hospital tracks patient wait times
→ Long waits are outliers → Use **Median + IQR**

**Scenario 4:** A poll asks voters' favorite candidate
→ Categorical data → Use **Mode**

**Scenario 5:** A teacher compares two classes' exam consistency
→ Compare variability → Use **Std Dev**

::: {.callout-note}
## 💡 Always visualize first!
A quick histogram or box plot helps you see the shape of data and choose the right measure.

# Part 4: Real-World Use Cases

## Use Case 1 — Analyzing Exam Results

**Scenario:** A teacher has exam scores from 15 students:
```
55, 62, 70, 73, 75, 78, 80, 82, 82, 85, 88, 90, 92, 95, 45
```

**Analysis:**
```
Mean   = (sum) / 15 = 1152 / 15 = 76.8
Median = 82  (8th value)
Mode   = 82  (appears twice)
Range  = 95 − 45 = 50
Std Dev ≈ 14.2
Q1 = 72,  Q3 = 89,  IQR = 17
Outlier check: Lower = 72 − 25.5 = 46.5 → 45 is borderline!
               Upper = 89 + 25.5 = 114.5 → No high outliers
```

**Insights:** Mean ≈ Median → roughly symmetric. Score of 45 may need attention. Std dev of 14.2 indicates moderate spread.

## Use Case 2 — E-Commerce Sales Analysis

**Scenario:** Daily revenue ($) for an online store over 10 days:
```
1200, 980, 1450, 1100, 1320, 850, 5600, 1250, 1180, 1070
```

```
Mean   = 15000 / 10 = $1,500
Median = (1200 + 1250) / 2 = $1,225   ← better "typical day"
Mode   = None (all unique)
Range  = 5600 − 850 = $4,750
Std Dev ≈ $1,398  (very large — driven by $5,600 outlier)
Q1 = 1035, Q3 = 1387.5, IQR = $352.5
Outlier: Upper fence = 1387.5 + 1.5×352.5 = $1,916
→ $5,600 IS an outlier! (Probably a flash sale or viral post)
```

**Business insight:** A "typical" day brings in ~$1,225. The $5,600 day was exceptional — don't plan budgets around it!

## Use Case 3 — Quality Control in Manufacturing

**Scenario:** A machine fills bottles with juice. Target: 500ml. Sample (ml):
```
499.2, 500.1, 498.8, 500.5, 499.7, 500.2, 501.0, 499.5, 500.3, 498.9
```

```
Mean   = 4998.2 / 10 = 499.82 ml   (close to target ✅)
Std Dev ≈ 0.67 ml

Acceptable range: 500 ± 2ml = [498, 502]
All values within range → Machine is operating correctly ✅

If Std Dev were 5 ml → values would spread from ~490 to ~510
→ Many bottles would be out of specification ❌
```

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Quality Control Rule
Small std dev = consistent quality. Large std dev = inconsistent = defects and waste.
The **mean tells you if you're on target; std dev tells you how consistent you are**.
:::

## Use Case 4 — Finance & Investment Risk

**Scenario:** Monthly returns (%) for two investment funds:

```
Fund A: 2.1, 1.8, 2.3, 2.0, 1.9, 2.2, 2.0, 1.7, 2.1, 2.4
Fund B: 5.2, −3.1, 8.4, −2.0, 6.7, −1.5, 9.1, −4.2, 7.3, 1.1
```

| | Fund A | Fund B |
|-|--------|--------|
| Mean return | **2.05%** | **2.70%** |
| Std Dev | **0.21%** | **5.23%** |
| Min/Max | 1.7% / 2.4% | −4.2% / 9.1% |

**Analysis:** Fund B has higher average returns, but 25× more volatility than Fund A!

- Conservative investor (near retirement) → Choose **Fund A**
- Aggressive investor (young, long-term) → May choose **Fund B**

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 In finance, Std Dev = Risk
The entire field of portfolio management is built on this insight!
:::

## Use Case 5 — Healthcare: Blood Pressure Study

**Scenario:** Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) of 12 patients:
```
115, 122, 118, 135, 128, 120, 142, 119, 125, 130, 116, 180
```

```
Mean   = 1550 / 12 ≈ 129.2 mmHg
Median = (122 + 125) / 2 = 123.5 mmHg
Std Dev ≈ 18.4 mmHg
Q1 = 118.25,  Q3 = 131.25,  IQR = 13.0

Outlier fence: 131.25 + 1.5×13 = 150.75
→ 180 mmHg is an OUTLIER 🚨 → Hypertensive crisis! Needs immediate attention!
```

**Clinical insight:** Most patients are near-normal (median 123.5), but one patient at 180 mmHg requires urgent intervention. The outlier detection potentially saves a life!

## Use Case 6 — Sports Performance Analysis

**Scenario:** Goals scored by two football strikers across 12 matches:

```
Player A: 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1   → consistent scorer
Player B: 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3   → feast-or-famine scorer
```

| Statistic | Player A | Player B |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Total Goals | 12 | 18 |
| Mean | 1.0 | 1.5 |
| Median | 1.0 | 0.0 |
| Std Dev | 0.74 | 2.23 |

**Player B scores more total goals, but is highly unpredictable (high std dev). Player A is reliable.**

Different teams need different types based on their game strategy!

## Final Challenge — Real Dataset Analysis

**Your task:** Analyze this real sales dataset and produce a full report.

```python
import statistics

# Monthly sales ($) for 3 products over 12 months
product_A = [1200, 1350, 1100, 1450, 1300, 1250,
             1380, 1420, 1280, 1310, 1190, 1360]

product_B = [800, 2100, 650, 1900, 750, 2300,
             900, 1800, 700, 2000, 850, 2200]

product_C = [500, 520, 510, 490, 5000, 505,
             495, 515, 500, 510, 498, 502]

# ============================================
# Your tasks:
# 1. For EACH product, calculate and print:
#    - Mean, Median, Mode
#    - Range, Std Dev, IQR
#    - Detect outliers using IQR method
#
# 2. Answer these questions in your code comments:
#    - Which product has the most consistent sales?
#    - Which product has an obvious outlier? What month?
#    - Which product is most predictable for budgeting?
#    - Would you use mean or median for each product? Why?
# ============================================
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## 💡 Hints
- Call your `describe()` function on each product list
- A high std dev relative to mean = unpredictable
- An outlier might be a holiday promotion, data entry error, or one-time event

## Summary: Descriptive Statistics

**What you've learned today:**

| Category | Measures | Best Used When |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Central Tendency** | Mean, Median, Mode | Symmetric / Skewed / Categorical |
| **Dispersion** | Range, Variance, Std Dev, IQR | Quick view / Precise / Outlier-robust |

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- **Mean** = fair average, sensitive to outliers
- **Median** = middle value, robust to outliers
- **Mode** = most common, works for categories
- **Std Dev** = typical distance from mean, same units as data
- **IQR** = spread of middle 50%, unaffected by outliers
- Always **pair** central tendency with dispersion — one without the other is incomplete!
- When in doubt: check for outliers first, then choose your measures
:::

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

```
❌ Reporting only the mean without any dispersion measure
   → The mean of 75 means nothing without knowing the spread!

❌ Using mean with heavily skewed or outlier-affected data
   → Use median instead for income, house prices, wait times

❌ Confusing variance and standard deviation units
   → Variance is in squared units; std dev is in original units

❌ Forgetting to sort before finding the median
   → Median of unsorted data is meaningless!

❌ Assuming mode always exists
   → If all values are unique, there is no mode

❌ Ignoring outliers without investigating them
   → Outliers are often the most interesting and important data points!
```

## Quick Reference Card

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} \qquad \text{(Mean)}$$

$$\text{Median} = \text{middle value of sorted data}$$
